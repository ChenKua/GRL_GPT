Provide user-friendly interface\n","2. Efficient product search\n","3. Secure payment processing\n","\n","Actor 2: Customer\n","Goals:\n","1. Find desired products\n","2. Check product details\n","3.

Actor 1 (Secure payment processing) - Means-Ends -> Actor 2 (Make purchases effortlessly)\n","5. Actor 2 (Find desired products) - OR -> Actor 2 (Check product details)\n","2\n","In Tropos goal-oriented modeling language, we model actors, their goals, and relationships between the actors. Here's a sample goal model:\n","\n","1. Actors:\n","   - Actor 1: Customer\n","   - Actor 2: OnlineStore\n","\n","2. Goals:\n","   - Customer Goals:\n","     - G1: Purchase products\n","     - G2: Find product information\n","     - G3: Receive order updates\n","\n","   - OnlineStore Goals:\n","     - G4: Sell products\n","     - G5: Provide product information\n","     - G6: Update order status\n","\n","3.

Each actor has several goals. The Customer's goals are to purchase products, find product information, and receive order updates. The OnlineStore's goals are to sell products, provide product information, and update order status.\n","\n","The relationships show how Customer goals depend on the OnlineStore goals. The Customer depends on the OnlineStore for purchasing products (G1 depends on G4), finding product information (G2 depends on G5), and receiving order updates (G3 depends on G6).\n","3\n","In a KAOS goal-oriented modeling language, a sample goal model will consist of agents, goals, and relationships between these goals. Below is a simple representation of a goal model with two agents and several goals.\n","\n","Agents:\n","1. Student\n","2. CourseInstructor\n","\n","Goals for Student:\n","G1: Efficiently complete course assignments.\n","G2: Understand course material.\n","G3: Set up office hours with the course instructor to ask questions.\n","G4: Attend all lectures.\n","\n","Goals for CourseInstructor:\n","G5: Prepare and deliver lectures.\n","G6: Provide additional resources for students.\n","G7: Organize and manage office hours.\n","G8: Ensure clear communication of course expectations.\n","\n","Relationships:\n","1. OR-refinement between G1 and G2 - This relationship implies that the Student can achieve the goal \"Efficiently complete course assignments\" by either understanding the course material or by another means.\n","2. AND-refinement between G3 and G1 - This relationship implies that setting up office hours with the course instructor helps the student in efficiently completing the course assignments.\n","3. AND-refinement between G7 and G5 - This relationship implies that organizing and managing office hours contribute to the course instructor's goal of providing efficient lectures.\n","4. AND-refinement between G6 and G5 - This relationship implies that providing additional resources for students supports the course instructor's goal of preparing and delivering lectures.\n","\n","In this sample goal model, the Student and CourseInstructor agents have their respective goals. The relationships help understand the interdependence of the goals and how achieving them can fulfill overall objectives.\n","4\n","Similarities between GRL, Tropos, i*, and KAOS goal-oriented modeling languages:\n","\n","1. All four languages focus on the identification and modeling of stakeholders' goals, intentions, and requirements in the requirements engineering process.\n","2. They represent goals and associated relationships (dependencies, contributions, etc.) graphically through node-link diagrams.\n","3. They emphasize the iterative nature of requirement elicitation, analysis, and negotiation by enabling refinement and evaluation of alternatives.\n","4. Actors, goals, soft goals, and other related elements are used to build models in each of these languages.\n","\n","Differences between GRL, Tropos, i*, and KAOS goal-oriented modeling languages:\n","\n","1. GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language) is a graphical notation for specifying goals and relationships, supporting evaluation of alternative solutions, and is part of the User Requirements Notation.\n","2. Tropos is based on i* and enhances it by introducing concepts like planning and plan execution to manage the complete software development process, including requirements analysis, architecture design, and detailed design. Tropos focuses on agent-oriented techniques and places particular emphasis on modeling the relationship between the environment and the system being built.\n","3. i* (pronounced i-star) is the basis for many goal-oriented modeling languages, with a strong focus on modeling actor dependencies and social aspects. It uses Strategic Dependency Models (SD) and Strategic Rationale Models (SR) to represent stakeholder relationships and dependencies.\n","4. KAOS (Knowledge Acquisition in Automated Specification) takes an object-oriented approach and concentrates on formalizing complex goal structures, using concepts like objects, actions, agents, events, and goals. KAOS offers event-driven requirements elicitation and has a more hierarchical structure in comparison to the others.\n","\n","In summary, while all four languages share similarities in addressing stakeholders' goals and intentions, they differ in their specific modeling constructs, focus areas (such as agent-oriented approaches), and the level of formality and emphasis on different development phases.\n","5\n","Yes, there are textual grammars available for these goal-oriented requirement engineering languages. For instance, in GRL the User Requirements Notation language (URN) acts as its textual grammar, while in KAOS, the language uses the Objectiver tool as its textual grammar. However, Tropos and i* primarily rely on visual notations, and though there have been efforts to develop textual notations, no standard has been established for them.\n","6\n","1. Goal: A high-level objective that stakeholders seek to achieve.\n","2. Softgoal: A non-functional requirement that is typically subjective and hard to quantify.\n","3. Task: An executable action or process that contributes to achieving a goal.\n","4. Resource: A tangible or intangible asset required to perform a task or achieve a goal.\n","5. Actor: An entity, such as a person, organization, or system, responsible for carrying out tasks and achieving goals.\n","7\n","1. Contribution links: Indicate how a source element influences a target element in achieving a goal.\n","2. Decomposition links: Describe how high-level goals are decomposed into sub-goals or tasks.\n","3. Dependency links: Show how one intentional element depends on another for obtaining a resource or meeting a goal.\n","4. Correlation links: Represent side effects between source and target elements without a direct contribution.\n","8\n","GRL supports four types of qualitative contributions: Make (strong positive influence), Help (weak positive influence), Hurt (weak negative influence), and Break (strong negative influence).\n","9\n","The three main numerical attributes to define an indicator in GRL are:\n","\n","1. Initial value: The starting value of the indicator before any action is taken.\n","2. Target value: The desired value of the indicator after achieving the goal.\n","3. Threshold value: The minimum acceptable value for the indicator, below which corrective actions must be taken.\n","10\n","This statement is false. GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language) intentional elements are evaluated qualitatively on a [-1..1] scale, where 1 represents fully satisfied, 0 represents unknown or neutral state, and -1 represents fully denied. The scale is not [-100..100].\n","11\n","This statement is false. GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language) contributions can be negative, as they show the negative influence one element might have on another. Negative contributions help to identify conflicts and trade-offs between goals and other elements during requirement analysis.\n","12\n","True, a GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language) indicator converts an observable value in some unit to a unit-less satisfaction value. This is because GRL indicators are used to measure the progress towards achieving goals and soft-goals in the context of goal modeling, which typically deals with qualitative and unit-less satisfaction levels rather than specific quantitative units.\n","13\n","This statement is true. GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language) supports both agents and roles as types of actors. Agents are specific entities, individuals, or organizations responsible for achieving goals, while roles represent general categories of actors that can be assigned specific responsibilities in a software system.\n","14\n","In Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL), a contribution and a correlation represent relationships between different elements in the goal model. The main difference between them is:\n","\n","Contribution: It represents the causal relationship between two intentional elements (goals, softgoals, tasks, and resources) in GRL, indicating whether the satisfaction or denial of the source element positively or negatively affects the target element. Contributions can be qualitative (make, help, hurt, or break) or quantitative (with numerical values).\n","\n","Correlation: It represents the non-causal relationship between two intentional elements, where changes in the evaluation of the source element influence the target element, but without a direct causal effect. Correlations show the side-effects or dependencies between elements that must be considered for the overall analysis, but they do not indicate a direct impact like contributions.\n","15\n","In GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language), a goal represents a functional requirement that has a clear, tangible, and measurable result. It can be satisfied or not, and its satisfaction can be evaluated objectively.\n","\n","A softgoal, on the other hand, represents a non-functional requirement with no clear-cut criteria for satisfaction or evaluation. Softgoals can only be partially satisfied in a continuous range and are usually subjective, relating to qualities like usability, performance, or security.\n","16\n","Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) supports the modeling of adaptive socio-technical systems by providing a comprehensive framework to represent, analyze, and reason about the goals, intentions, and motivations of different stakeholders in the system. By using GRL, system designers can model qualitative and quantitative aspects of a socio-technical system, enabling better understanding and identification of alternatives and trade-offs. The key support mechanisms are:\n","\n","1. Clear representation of goals: GRL provides a visual notation to represent different types of goals, tasks, resources, and softgoals, allowing the system designer to clearly model the stakeholder's intentions and motivations.\n","\n","2. Formalization of relationships: GRL enables the definition of links such as dependencies, contributions, and decompositions, which help capture relationships between goals, tasks, and actors within the system.\n","\n","3. Multi-stakeholder perspective: GRL supports the representation of different stakeholder perspectives, ensuring that the objectives and motivations of all stakeholders are considered in the modeling process.\n","\n","4. Evaluation of alternatives: By quantitatively assigning evaluations to elements and propagating these values along links, GRL supports the assessment of different alternatives (e.g., design choices) and supports decision-making based on the best trade-offs.\n","\n","5. Adaptivity: GRL models can be extended to include dynamic aspects and capture possible changes in the system’s environment, enabling the analysis of the system’s behavior in response to changing conditions, ensuring the adaptiveness of the socio-technical system.\n","\n","Overall, by capturing the complexities of a socio-technical system in a clear and concise manner, GRL helps system designers comprehend, design, and evaluate adaptive socio-technical systems effectively.\n","17\n","In the GRL model, we will have a main goal and three indicators - Hypoglycemia, Normal, and Hyperglycemia - to determine the blood glucose level of a patient with diabetes.\n","\n","Main Goal:\n","- Ensure satisfactory blood glucose level for a patient with diabetes\n","\n","Indicators:\n","\n","1. Hypoglycemia Indicator\n","- Target: 0.60 g/l (0% satisfaction)\n","- Threshold: 0.70 g/l (50% satisfaction)\n","- Worst-case: 0.00 g/l (100% satisfaction)\n","- Unit: g/l\n","\n","2. Normal Glucose Level Indicator\n","- Target: 0.90 g/l (100% satisfaction)\n","- Threshold: 0.80 g/l (50% satisfaction)\n","- Worst-case: 1.00 g/l (0% satisfaction)\n","- Unit: g/l\n","\n","3. Hyperglycemia Indicator\n","- Target: 1.10 g/l (0% satisfaction)\n","- Threshold: 1.01 g/l (50% satisfaction)\n","- Worst-case: 2.00 g/l (100% satisfaction)\n","- Unit: g/l\n","\n","The main goal is connected to the three indicators. The model evaluates and converts glucose levels into a GRL satisfaction level. Hypoglycemia and Hyperglycemia indicators have inverse satisfaction levels as the goal is to avoid them. The Normal Glucose Level indicator has a direct satisfaction level. The combination of these three indicators allows us to create a complex function that captures the complete range of glucose levels and their satisfaction levels.\n","\n","In this way, the GRL model effectively determines whether a patient with diabetes has a satisfactory blood glucose level when not eating by considering hypoglycemia, normal level, and hyperglycemia indicators with their respective target, threshold, and worst-case values.\n","18\n","In order to correct the mistake in the goal model of the Movie Awards and Rating System (MARS), we need to first identify the goals, actors, and relationships between them as the GRL goal model depends on these elements.\n","\n","From the given domain context, we can identify the following main actors and their goals:\n","\n","1. Award Organization:\n","    - Advertise winners and nominees of movie awards\n","    - Create a new award category if needed\n","\n","2. Production Company:\n","    - Advertise TV series and movies\n","    - Add crew member info for each produced show\n","    - Specify the position of the crew member for the produced show\n","\n","3. Members:\n","    - Rate movies and TV series episodes\n","\n","Considering these goals and the domain context, we can identify a mistake in the given goal model if there is an incorrect relationship or dependency between the actors and their goals or if a goal is not properly represented in the model. With the provided information, we can't pinpoint the exact mistake in the goal model as the model itself isn't given. However, when creating or correcting the goal model, we must ensure that it accurately captures the relationships and dependencies between the three main actors of the MARS and their respective goals.\n","19\n","To correct the mistake in the goal model, we first need to identify the mistake. One potential mistake is related to the account registration process, specifically the requirement for user identification verification mandated by some jurisdictions, which isn't mentioned in the goal model.\n","\n","To correct the goal model, you should include a soft goal that captures the need for meeting the legal requirements or complying with regulations. This soft goal could be named \"Comply with Legal Requirements\" and could be linked to the \"Account Registration\" task in the model. To operationalize this soft goal, you could introduce a new task for \"ID Verification\" that connects to the \"Account Registration\" task and contributes positively (+) to the \"Comply with Legal Requirements\" goal. This would ensure the goal model captures the necessary provisions for following jurisdictional regulations related to user identification.\n","20\n","To correct the mistake in the goal model for the Movie Awards and Rating System (MARS), we need to identify the essential elements in the description and analyze the goal model in this context. Although the question does not provide the flawed goal model, based on the given description, here are the possible issues and corrections:\n","\n","1. Ensure there are goals for all core functionality mentioned in the description, such as advertising winners and nominees, advertising TV series and movies, and rating.\n","\n","2. Include actors for award organizations, production companies, and members as stakeholders interacting with the system.\n","\n","3. Add conditions for payment and third-party verification in the description, making sure that the goals related to user account creation have verification and payment options as sub-goals.\n","\n","4. Revise the elements for account creation, making sure the model captures all necessary information, such as the name of the award organization and production company, and the nickname for members.\n","\n","5. Ensure there are goals for managing award categories for organizations, allowing modifications and new category creations.\n","\n","6. Verify that the goal model includes management of TV series information and various scheduling patterns for seasons.\n","\n","7. Include the goals for managing crew member information, such as their names, date of birth, short bio, and positions for each production.\n","\n","8. In the goal model, ensure there is a goal for members to rate movies or episodes of TV series, with ranks from zero to five stars.\n","\n","To conclude, any necessary corrections are made by ensuring the goal model covers all key features and requirements described in the domain context. Further, it is important to include actors, goals, and interactions in accordance with the context and to accurately reflect the functional flow of the MARS.\n","21\n","To correct the mistake in the goal model, analyze the description of the Movie Awards and Rating System (MARS) and verify the relationships, dependencies, and constraints present in the model. Compare them with the given context and ensure the intended functionality is accurately represented. \n","\n","For instance, in the goal model:\n","1. Ensure that the relationships between award organizations, production companies, and members are correctly established.\n","2. Verify that the regular and pro versions of MARS are distinguished, with their respective features and services accurately represented.\n","3. Check that user verification and payment through third-party services are incorporated in the model.\n","4. Confirm that award organizations can manage award categories, including creating new ones if needed.\n","5. Make sure the involvement of production companies in advertising and managing TV series and movies is accurately depicted.\n","6. Lastly, make certain that members can rate movies and TV episodes.\n","\n","As the exact mistake is not provided, a thorough evaluation of the goal model against the MARS description is necessary to ensure that it accurately captures the functionality and constraints mentioned in the given context.\n","22\n","To correct the mistake in the goal model, change the direction of the contribution between \"Maximize advertising for show\" and \"Provide timely information about show.\" This correction implies that maximizing advertising for the show will positively contribute to providing timely information about the show to the users of the MARS system.

It allows capturing and structuring the rationale behind system objectives in various contexts and enables the identification of alternative design solutions. The key features of GRL that support adaptive socio-technical systems modeling are:\n","\n","1. Intentional Elements: GRL focuses on modeling stakeholder intentions such as goals, softgoals, tasks, and resources, as well as actors responsible for accomplishing them. This helps in understanding the motives that drive adaptive behavior in socio-technical systems.\n","\n","2. Relationships: GRL allows modeling dependencies among intentional elements, as well as the influence of one element on another. This helps in establishing connections and understanding the impact of various goals on each other, which is essential in adapting to change in socio-technical systems.\n","\n","3. Evaluation: By using qualitative and quantitative evaluation methods, GRL helps in assessing the feasibility, desirability, and priority of alternative design solutions, leading to the selection of the best-fit solution for the given context.\n","\n","4. Change Propagation: GRL models facilitate understanding the cascading effects of implementing a specific design solution or altering a requirement, which is essential in the context of adaptive socio-technical systems that continuously evolve and adjust to new circumstances.\n","\n","5. Adaptation Scenarios: GRL enables the development of different scenarios for goal satisfaction by considering possible changes in the environment, technology, or stakeholder preferences, facilitating proactive adaptation planning.\n","\n","In summary, GRL provides the means to model, analyze, and evaluate stakeholder goals and their interdependencies in adaptive socio-technical systems, helping designers choose suitable designs that can accommodate the evolving requirements and contexts of these systems.\n","17\n","In the GRL model, we have one main goal, which is \"Maintain Satisfactory Blood Glucose Level\".
