true. GRL, or Gross Rating Points, is a metric used in advertising to measure the impact of an ad campaign. It is calculated by multiplying the Reach (the percentage of the target audience exposed to the ad) by the Frequency (the average number of times the target audience sees the ad).\n","\n","Since both Reach and Frequency are positive values (you cannot have a negative percentage or a negative number of ad exposures), the result of their multiplication (GRL) will always be a positive value or zero. Therefore, GRL contributions cannot be negative.\n","12\n","This statement is true.\n","\n","A GRL (Goal-oriented Requirement Language) indicator is a measure that converts an observable value (e.g., response time, resource utilization, etc.) in some unit (e.g., seconds, percentage, etc.) into a unit-less satisfaction value. This satisfaction value lies within a range of 0 to 100, where 100 represents total satisfaction of the goal, and 0 represents no satisfaction. This conversion helps stakeholders to understand how well a system or process is meeting the defined goals and requirements.\n","13\n","This statement is true. GRL (Goal-oriented Requirements Language) is a language used for modeling intentions and dependencies among actors, usually in the context of system development. In GRL, actors can be either agents (individuals or groups of people) or roles (specific positions or functions), both having the ability to participate in the system and have goals or tasks related to the system.\n","14\n","In Group Reciprocity Lending (GRL), a contribution refers to the act of providing financial support, information, or resources to a group or an individual within the group. It represents a direct input or investment made by a member to help others in the group, which could be in the form of money, time, or effort. Contributions help build and strengthen social capital within the group, as members actively participate in the collective well-being and success of the group.\n","\n","On the other hand, a correlation in GRL refers to the statistical relationship between two or more factors, such as the relationship between loan repayment behavior and social ties within the group. Correlation helps in understanding whether there is an association between these factors, and if so, how strong that association is. However, correlation does not imply causation, which means that even though two factors might be correlated, one does not necessarily cause the other. Correlations can provide insights into how different factors are related, which can be helpful in designing better GRL systems and understanding the dynamics within a group.\n","\n","In summary, a contribution in GRL is about actively investing in the group in some form, while a correlation in GRL is about the relationship between different factors within the group lending context.\n","15\n","Goal-oriented Requirement Language (GRL) is a modeling language used to represent goals, tasks, and dependencies among them in a structured way. It helps stakeholders to analyze the requirements and make decisions based on various alternatives. In GRL, there are two main types of goals: softgoals and goals. The key difference between these two types is related to how they can be achieved and their level of detail.\n","\n","1. Goal: A goal in GRL represents a specific, well-defined objective that a system, process, or organization should achieve. Goals are clear, measurable, and quantifiable, which means that it's possible to determine if a goal has been satisfied or not. They are often expressed as a desired state or a precise target to be reached. Goals drive the system's functional requirements and can have clear success criteria.\n","\n","2. Softgoal: A softgoal, on the other hand, represents a more abstract, higher-level objective that may not be directly measurable or quantifiable. Softgoals are subjective, and their achievement depends on the preferences and priorities of the stakeholders. They typically represent non-functional requirements like quality attributes (e.g., usability, performance, security) and are open to interpretation. Softgoals can have multiple alternative solutions, and they do not have explicit success criteria.\n","\n","In summary, the primary difference between a goal and a softgoal in GRL lies in their level of specificity and measurability. Goals are concrete, measurable objectives with well-defined success criteria, while softgoals represent higher-level, qualitative objectives with multiple potential solutions and no well-defined success criteria.\n","16\n","GRL, or Goal-oriented Requirement Language, is a graphical modeling language used to model high-level goals and requirements of socio-technical systems. Adaptive socio-technical systems are complex environments consisting of both social (people, organizations, etc.) and technical (hardware, software, etc.) components that can adapt to changes in their operational context. GRL supports the modeling of adaptive socio-technical systems in several ways:\n","\n","1. Goal modeling: GRL allows the representation of high-level goals for the socio-technical system, which are essential in defining the purpose and desired outcomes of the system. It helps stakeholders to understand why a feature or functionality is needed, and it provides a way to evaluate alternative solutions from a goal satisfaction perspective.\n","\n","2. Intentional elements: GRL provides intentional elements (goals, tasks, resources, and softgoals) that capture the stakeholders' intentions and allow the modeling of both social and technical aspects of a system. These elements help to identify the reasons behind various design decisions in the system and trace them back to stakeholders' motivations and intentions.\n","\n","3. Dependencies and relationships: GRL models the relationships and dependencies among different aspects of the socio-technical system, enabling the modeling of their interactions and influences on each other. This helps in uncovering potential conflicts, trade-offs, and synergies among different elements in the system and allows the system to adapt to changing requirements and context.\n","\n","4. Evaluation and reasoning: GRL supports the evaluation of models by assigning satisfaction values to intentional elements and performing reasoning on a model to determine its overall satisfaction level. This enables stakeholders to explore different design alternatives and assess their impact on the overall goal fulfillment, helping to design an adaptive socio-technical system that can cater to varying situations and needs.\n","\n","5. Actor modeling: GRL allows for the representation of actors, which can be individual stakeholders, groups, or organizations in the socio-technical system. Actors have intentions, which can be goals, tasks, resources, or softgoals. This helps in understanding the roles, responsibilities, and motivations of different entities involved in the system, providing insights into how those entities may adapt to certain situations and contribute to the system's adaptability.\n","\n","6. Modularity and abstraction: GRL supports the abstraction and decomposition of large, complex socio-technical systems into smaller, manageable parts. This enables stakeholders to focus on specific aspects of the system, analyze them independently, and design adaptable solutions for each part. Modularity also facilitates the reuse and extension of existing models for other related systems.\n","\n","In summary, GRL provides a powerful language for representing stakeholders' intentions, goals, dependencies, and relationships in a socio-technical system. Its graphical nature facilitates easy communication and understanding among stakeholders, enabling them to design adaptive, flexible, and robust solutions for complex, evolving systems.\n","17\n","In this GRL model, we will use three indicators to capture the complex function for determining satisfactory blood glucose levels for a diabetic patient. Each indicator is set up to capture hypoglycemia, normal blood glucose levels, and hyperglycemia. Here's the description of the model:\n","\n","1. Goal: \"Satisfactory Blood Glucose Level\"\n","\n","2. Indicators:\n","\n","  a. Indicator 1: \"Avoid Hypoglycemia\"\n","     - Unit: g/l (grams per liter)\n","     - Target: 0.60 g/l\n","     - Threshold: 0.67 g/l (considering a 0.07 g/l buffer to avoid hypoglycemia)\n","     - Worst-case: 0.00 g/l (lowest possible blood glucose level)\n","\n","  b. Indicator 2: \"Maintain Normal Blood Glucose Level\"\n","     - Unit: g/l (grams per liter)\n","     - Target: 0.90 g/l (ideally the midpoint of the normal range)\n","     - Threshold: 0.80 g/l (lower end of normal range)\n","     - Worst-case: 1.00 g/l (upper end of normal range)\n","\n","  c.

A user of the MARS must sign up for an account with a username and password to gain access to the system. Award organization and production companies must provide their name, while members must provide their nicknames. The MARS comes in two versions – the free regular version and the paid pro version. In the pro version, users have access to (i) award information not only from the current year but also from previous years as well as (ii) statistics. In some jurisdictions, regulations require the identity of users to be verified through a third-party verification service during the account sign-up phase. The yearly payment for the pro version is also provided by a third-party service, but no payment-related information is kept in the MARS for security reasons.\n","An award organization announces the winners of their yearly awards at a ceremony that is held in a different location each year. For example, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences gives the Academy Awards (Oscars) every year in several different categories such as Best Picture, Best Director, and Best Actor. Some time before the award ceremony, several nominees are announced for each category. The categories are often the same each year, but small changes have been made in the Oscar’s history. The MARS allows award organizations to create a new award category if none of the existing categories match. The same categories may be used by other awards, e.g., the Golden Globes also announce a Best Picture, Best Director, and so on. Although not very common, one organization may administer several yearly awards.\n","A production company may advertise their TV series and movies in the MARS. Only a single production company is responsible for a movie. The episodes of a TV series are organized into seasons, and a single production company is responsible for a season, i.e., the production company for a TV series may change from one season to another. Some production companies follow a September to April schedule for a season, while others follow a January to June schedule, while others follow a different yearly schedule altogether. For each produced show, a production company specifies the crew members (e.g., actors, directors, cinematographers, composers). For each crew member, the name of the artist, the date of birth, and a short bio are provided if this information does not yet exist in the MARS. Furthermore, the production company selects the position of the crew member for the produced show from a predefined list in the MARS.\n","Last but not least, a member may rate a movie or an episode of a TV series from one to five stars.\n","19\n","Domain Context: The Movie Awards and Rating System (MARS) is used by award organizations, productions companies, and members to advertise winners and nominees of movie awards, advertise TV series and movies, and rate episodes of TV series and movies, respectively.
